ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Alex and I'm a nanotechnology student
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in mostly computational simulations of 2D systems, condensed matter physics and optoelectronic properties of nanomaterials.
Curently focusing on the radiation-matter interactions at a anode-electrolyte interface and some calculations with graphene quantum dots.
